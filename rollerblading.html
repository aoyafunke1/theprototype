  <h3>My Start - Why I skate</h3>

  <p>
    Over a decade ago, a buddy and I were meeting up. I arrived, getting off the <br />
    dreary bus with what felt like a thousand people who had lives too important <br />
    for them to wait calmly while we all filtered out gracefully.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Following the sigh of relief, followed quickly by the taste of fresh, unused<br />
    air, I look up to catch a whirling noise I can hear in the distance - who should<br /> it
    be but the buddy of mine I was meeting up with!
  </p>
  <p>
    He came rocketing down toward me - his back facing me as his body charged<br />
    in my direction with no indication of slowly! He was...<a href="https://youtu.be/jkKcy_G5hbM"> skating backwards</a>! (video <br> I learned from 👍🏾)

      Going backwards was <em>the</em> coolest thing to my senses!

  <p>At that point, I knew I was already obsessed - I could feel my nervous energy bubble to <br />
    the top and I roared with excitment and disbelief and I knew I wanted... no, I needed to <br />
    to pull that off someday!

  <h3>My now - What I'm learning</h3>

    <p>
    That day came somewhere between trying to fit exercise into my daily routine<br />
    and not freaking out about COVID19 - it was the Summer of 2020. By stroke of<br /> chance,
    I remembered my buddy from years back and ordered my first pair. Full of <br> excitement
    I hastly ordered a pair and learned the hard way that I should do more <br> reading before
    buying the first pair I saw. Some modifications later, I was <br>soon practising in the

    I have since realised that to keep moving, it helps to be internally <br /> motivated; if your
    for moving comes from a geniuine passion, your days of Googling,<br> "how can I be motivated to..." are over.</p>
